# Enabling GitHub Pages for the Proposal

To make the proposal live using GitHub Pages, follow these instructions:

1. **Navigate to your repository**: Go to the [Deepsekhar-eng/Proposal.anima](https://github.com/Deepsekhar-eng/Proposal.anima) repository.

2. **Access the Settings tab**: Click on the `Settings` tab at the top of the repository page.

3. **Locate the Pages section**: Scroll down to the `Pages` section in the settings menu.

4. **Select the source**: Under `Source`, select the branch you wish to publish from (usually `main`), and choose the root folder if necessary.

5. **Save your changes**: Click `Save` to apply the settings.

6. **Access your live site**: After a few minutes, your site will be published at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>` (replace `<username>` with `Deepsekhar-eng` and `<repository>` with `Proposal.anima`).

7. **Verify the deployment**: Once published, check the URL to ensure everything is working correctly.

8. **Make updates if necessary**: You can continue to update your proposal by making changes in the repository, and it will automatically update on the GitHub Pages site after each commit.
